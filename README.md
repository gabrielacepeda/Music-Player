# Music-Player
This app plays music from a small playlist I created using the HTML5 audio API.

## Project Details
- UI includes spinning image while song plays with song detail pop up
- Play, pause, prev and next functionality
- Progress Bar 

## Optimizations
Currently the progress bar does not allow you to skip through the song in the progress bar. I'm working through an error to fix this.
